## Website overview
The website is organised into sections, represented by distinct panels. Each section can be quickly accessed through the top navigation bar. The website uses a handmade animated gradient wallpaper and it supports dark/light theme too.

### Navigation bar
The website's navbar is split into two main sections:
- the first section, on the left, showcases a PC Terminal logo which also acts as a dark/light theme switch button
- the second section, on the right, offers a shortcut to the other website sections

The navbar was styled according to a "frosted glass" effect, with a slight drop shadow in light mode which turns into a dim highlight for the theme-switch button during dark mode.
The navbar shortcut elements were given a handmade underline which also animates on mouse hover.

### Home section
The website's Home section is the first element of the page upon loading.
The Home section introduces the viewer to my bio. Placeholders have been added during the development process.

The Home section was styled according to a "frosted glass" effect, with a slight drop shadow.
